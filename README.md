In this folder I am presenting three Power BI projects that I have created.

First Project : Covid World Wide calculations 

The goal in this project is to take calculations done in MySQL and import them into Power BI and create a dashboard where we can display the covid numbers in Poland and also world-wide.

The focus is on covid deaths and covid vaccinations, we can see how is Poland dealing with Covid, by analyzing the % of deaths, % of vaccinations, % of infected population, the most days with vaccination, deaths and covid cases.

When it comes to world-wide calculations, we can see the continents with most deaths, countries with most deaths and vaccination given, countries with most tests done etc.

The goal is to create a simple and readable project for technical or non-technical people to understand.

Second project : Bank Customer Churn 

This project was done fully in Power BI using Power Query and DAX. It presents analyzing the behavior of customers who have left a bank to identify patterns and reasons for their departure. It's done on 10.000 users in France, Spain and Germany. We can analyze the reasons for their departure by looking at their satisfaction score, age group, credit score, their activity in the bank, number of products they had etc. The goal is to create a simple interactive dashboard that can be easily understood by any person who will interact with it.

Third Project : Space Missions
I was always interested in Space, so this project was fun to work on it. It's a nice and simple project where I was putting more attention on creating visually nice dashboard, putting more time and effort to blend the colors nicely, and creating bookmarks. Here in Power Query few changes were done, like changing the original data type and creating new columns, in M language new table with measures was created and few new measures were done in order to calculate KP
